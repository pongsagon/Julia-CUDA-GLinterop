# Julia-CUDA-GLinterop
Using CUDA to compute Julia fractal, drawing using OpenGL, use win32 for touch input <br />
Rendering at 4K, each pixel compute using 1200 iterations, running at 10-15fps on RTX4090 <br />

## User guides
The code uses touch input.  You can add glfw code for keyboard and mouse inputs <br />
move one finger to pan <br />
move two fingers up and down to zoom <br />
move three fingers to change seed <br/>


## Compiling using MSVC 2022

## Acknowledgement
The Julia CUDA code is based on the code from "CUDA by examples" book.
